# EAS-E
## Inspiration
73% of students in 2018 studying through private, for-profit institutions enrolled in distance education,
34.1% of students at public institutions the same year took online courses, and 
30.4% of students at private non-profit schools enrolled in distance education.

On top of this, I being high schoolers who have the high school burden online, we have sensed the struggle not only for ourselves but for those of other peers who often come to us for help. As a result, this inspired us to create this project.
## What it does
The first section is an area where tutors can make posts for any students to require help to respond to. As a tutor I fill in several fields such as the subjects I wish to tutor, my phone number, email address, name and description and I am able to post a post. Additionally, if I choose to tutor as a volunteer I can enter Free in the costs column. This allows users to simply  add
 
The second section is a help section where students having problems with certain questions can enter them or information they wish to retrieve using Wolfram Simple API. I am able to go to that page and for example enter “Who was George Washington” and a detailed answer and facts in relation to him comes up.

The third section is the courses tabs which users can use in order to find courses to either learn more or seek help via a course in order to learn more or develop that skill further. Here there are a few find pre-selected courses such as Computer Science, Data Science, Calculus 1 for options but instead I will use the custom query input where I can input a course that I might want to find and a list of courses come out of the output using ClassPert Course Search API

The fourth section is a build your own resume section. Users will answer some questions and the program will write a professionally written resume. In the future, I would like to use sentimental analysis to make sure that the tone is as accurate as can be. Each resume comes with 5 sections such as awards, experience, interests, etc. We know writing the perfect resume is tough and must be better than ever due to how many jobs have been displaced due to the pandemic; hence we chose to make the resume builder.
